Currently working on building user profile...

## Setup

Remeber to run `npm i` to install all necessary packages. 

To add the API key for the authorization actions, create a file named `keys.js` in the root folder of the project and add the following code to the file:

```
export const API_KEY = [API_KEY_AS_A_STRING_HERE];
```

Where API_KEY_AS_A_STRING_HERE is the Firebase Web API Key (found in the Project Settings) as a string.
